Analysis process:

Pre-processing:
	Generate a boundary (maximum radius, maximum height)
	Take input r-z map of boundaries with materials in these spaces
	
Initiating event (neutron source) with E=E0 (14.1MeV)
Randomised unit vector using RN1 and RN2 from start point (may be RN0 if neutron source)
Generate 3D line from start point to boundary
Convert to 2D line equating x,y to r
Generate line intersections
Generate RN3 and compare to likelihood of reaction between intersections
If no reaction, lose neutron
Else if reaction in boundary determined by RN3, generate RN4 and find which reaction occurs
	If reaction is neutron death:
		if neutron death leads to tritium, add to TBR
		else if neutron death produces no tritium, end sequence
	If reaction is neutron multiplication:
		Start new sequence
	If reaction is collision:
		Generate RN5 to find scattering angle and RN6 to find random orientation angle
		If collision is elastic:
			Start new sequence with E1=E0*f(theta)=E0*g(RN5)
		If collision is inelastic:
			Start new sequence with E1=(E0-E_reac)*f(theta)=(E0-E_reac)*g(RN5)
If neutrons generated are part of a >=3 body reaction, split the energy by some method (TBD)

Work to do:
Plasma profile generator: input from Jon Shimwell
	Likelihood is three random numbers: a,theta as position from magnetic axis, energy
